*Logic* [f1]_

Sir Robert Brycen Hall II, originally from Gaithersburg Maryland.
Being a mixed child he was told that he didn't deserve
white privilege or that he would never understand the
struggles that black communities have to go through.
Logic grew up in poverty inside a drug abusive household
and quickly relied on the streets as an outlet.
At the age of 14 he found a love for rap after watching
*Quentin Tarantino*. At 17 years old he ran away from home
due to his abusive mother and began pursuing his music career.
In 2009 he released *Logic: The Mix-tape* and started
performing with the name of "Psychological". In 2010 he released
an album called "Young, Broke & Infamous" which
later led to a contract with Visionary Music Group.
Upon his popularity he then released the "Young Sinatra"
trilogy and eventually signed a contract with Def Jam Records.
By the year of 2014, he released his first album under
Def Jam called "Under Pressure" which prompted his fame.
Logic has now had multiple successful albums:

* The Incredible True Story
* Bobby Tarantino
* Everybody

Along with successful singles:

* Flexicution
* 44Barz
* 44More
* 1800-273-8255

Logic eventually achieved his dream of collaborating with
his idol Eminem on the song "Homicide". Logic now owns his
own record label called BobbyBoy Records and has already
signed more than three artists. His most recent album is
**Confessions of a Dangerous Mind**. [f2]_
