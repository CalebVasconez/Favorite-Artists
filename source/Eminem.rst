*Eminem* [f1]_

Eminem's real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III.
He was originally born in Saint Joseph, Missouri
and later relocated to Detroit, Michigan.
His mother had a rough time moving back and forth
between Missouri and Michigan after his father had
left at the age of six months. While settling down
in Detroit, Marshall was bullied for his looks and
for being an *outsider*. His mother became addicted
to prescription pills as discussed in many of his songs.
His first album Infinite blew up in 1996, as he started
getting a deserving recognition for being a white artist
coming into a predominantly black industry.

He was noticed at the Rap Olympics in 1997 and
earned second place to a man who knew the judges.
He gave his mix-tape to a man who knew Doctor Dre
and stemmed a meeting with the infamous NWA artist.
From that meeting came his top singles:
"My Name Is", "The Real Slim Shady".
Eventually his first Billboard album "The Slim Shady LP".
Since then, Eminem has sold over 49.1 million albums,
and is known for having the most insane lyricism.
Eminem's most recent album is **Kamikaze**. [f2]_
