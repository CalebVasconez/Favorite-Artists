**Biography**

Shania Twain, born Eilleen Regina Edwards, was born
on August 28, 1965 in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. One
of her honorary titles is "Queen of Country Pop" [#]_.
She grew up in a household where her biological parents
divorced at a young age, and money and food was often
scarce. She sang in bars at the age of eight to try and
earn some sort of financial assistance for her family.
She wrote her first songs at 10, and at age 13 was
invited to perform in the Tommy Hunter Show.

After graduating Timmins High in 1983, a cover band
called "Flirt" approached her and she toured with
them throughout Ontario. She caught the attention of
a DJ, who took her to Nashville to record some demos.
In the early 90s, she caught the attention of a few
labels and changed her name to Shania Twain.

Her album *The Woman in Me* was released in February
of 1995, with the song "Whose bed have your boots been
under?" going to no. 11 on the Billboard Country Chart.
After this, several of her songs became hits, one of
which was even selected for the original soundtrack of
the film *Twister* (1996). Twain launched her first major
concert tour in 1998, winning the "Country Tour of the
Year" in 1998 and 1999. Divorce and 'personal pains'
led to a delay of an album in 2009, and she returned in
2011. She made a handful of appearances on *Good Morning
America* and performed two concerts at the 2014
Calgary Stampede. In June 2019, she announced her
next concert residency *Shania: Let's Go! The Las
Vegas Residency*, which will run for two years.
Her net worth is $400 million [#]_.
