About
-----

**J-Cole** was born at a U.S Army Base in West Germany.
When Cole was a baby, his mom relocated to
North Carolina and remained in poverty for a big span
of his childhood. His mother remarried to a man that
was also in the Army.
However, the marriage failed as his stepfather
became abusive which drove his mother to become
addicted to crack. Constantly moving from trailer park to trailer park,
Cole began writing his own music.
While growing up in a broken household,
Cole not only wrote but produced as well.

He started pushing his own mix-tapes and soon signed to
'Roc Nation'. Before he signed, Cole actually tried giving a
sample to Jay-Z which he rudely refused.
His debut studio album "Cole World" was utterly
successful which featured the hit single, "Work Out".
Cole rose to fame and was Number 1 on the Billboard
200 with singles from "2014 Forest Hills Drive"
and "4 Your Eyez Only". Cole has produced for Kendrick Lamar
and has been recognized by *Barack Obama*. He broke *Spotify's* streaming
record with his album 'KOD'. Since then, Cole has appeared
repeatedly on the Billboard charts with his album **KOD**. [#]_
