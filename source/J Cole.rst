About
-----

J-Cole was born at a U.S Army Base in West Germany.
When Cole was a baby, his mom relocated to
North Carolina and remained in poverty for a big span
of his childhood. His mother remarried to a man that
was also in the Army.
However, the marriage failed as his stepfather
became abusive which drove his mother to become
addicted to crack. While growing up in a broken household,
Cole began writing and producing
his own mix-tapes and soon signed to ‘Roc Nation’.
His debut studio album **Cole World** was utterly
successful which featured the hit single, "Work Out".
Cole rose to fame and was Number 1 on the Billboard
200 with singles from **2014 Forest Hills Drive**
and **4 Your Eyez Only**. Since then, Cole has appeared
repeatedly on the Billboard charts with his most
recent album **KOD**.
