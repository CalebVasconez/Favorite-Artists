About
-----

**Gary Lucas** was born and raised on the East Coast.
Lucas was very young when his parents went through
a difficult divorce. He has two siblings.
His stepfather played a huge role in his upbringing.
Lucas started writing his own
raps by the age of seven. He then decided on the stage name
'Future Joyner' but decided to just go with Joyner after the
rapper Future got famous.

Joyner rose to fame in 2015 with his mix-tape,"Along Came Joyner".
This mix-tape featured his breakout single, "Ross Capicchioni".
Joyner would go on to produce several more successful singles.
Out of those singles was the grammy-nominated song, "I'm Not Racist".

unification in America. This is still Joyner's most well-known
song to this day.
