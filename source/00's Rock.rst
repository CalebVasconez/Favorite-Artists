About
-----

The band Foo Fighters was started in 1994 in Seattle, Washington. It was founded by the Drummer
of Nirvana David Grohl after the suicide of Nirvanaâ€™s Lead singer Kurt Cobain. David Grohl then
recruited Bassist Nate Mendal, Guitarist Pat Smear, and drummer William Goldsmith to the band.
Four of the Bands albums have received Grammy's for the best rock album. Since they are a newer
band they have not had the opportunity to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame yet.
The first album released by the band labeled Foo Fighters only featured David Grohl who played
all of the instruments for every song on the album. I personally like and appreciate the Foo
Fighters because they are one of the only rock bands in the current day that play real rock
music.
